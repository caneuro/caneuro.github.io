We use an interdisciplinary approach for investigations in the field of
**Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience**. Our investigations include research
perspectives and experimental approaches from Psychology, Neuroscience, Biology, Medicine, and Computing Sciences.

## Research topics

* **Affective Neuroscience**: Emotion recognition from voices, music, and faces
* **Social Neuroscience**: Identity recognition from human signals
* **Systems Neuroscience**: Structural and functional features of the limbic system
* **Forensic Psychology and Neuroscience**: Psychopathy, biometrics, eye-witness memory

## Research methods

* Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
* Surface electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial electrophysiology (iEEG)
* Single-cell spiking and cellular brain stimulation
* Computer-based information decoding and representation (AI / Machine Learning / Neural Networks)
* Visual and auditory psychophysics
* Clinical neuroscience of brain lesions
* Forensic experiments and psychopathological dimensions of crime
