New paper published in Emotion Review
by C Trevor and S Fruhholz.
We propose the socio-affective fiction (SAF) hypothesis as a
new theory on the evolution of music. Music presumably evolved as a signal for
SAF to increase the immersive potential of storytelling and thereby better
exercise people's emotions.
